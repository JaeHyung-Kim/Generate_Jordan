# Generate_Jordan

After mount the Google drive to the Google Colab, make sure the JordanDataset100x100 directory to located in /content/drive/My Drive/JordanDataset100x100

I wrote this code at 2019 July. The dataset I prepared is only for Jordan 1 Series, downloaded from stockx and too small, so the accurate training was hard to reach for this time

Due to small training set, the result is very sensitive with learning rate of generator and discriminator model.

If there were plenty of training data and GPUs with high performance, the pixel and the quality of the generated result will get higher.

Figure below is the initial generated designs.
